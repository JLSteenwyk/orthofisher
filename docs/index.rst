Introduction
------------

Automated and high-throughout identification of a predetermined set of orthologs can be a helpful task
for phylogenomics/phylogenetics, gene family copy number determination, etc. 

To facilitate these analyses, **orthofisher** conducts automated HMMsearches among a set of proteomes using
a predetermined set of orthologs. Sequence similarity searches classify results as multi-copy, single-copy,
or absent in a given genome. For the purposes of phylogenomics/phylogenetics, multi-fasta files are generated
for all sequences as well as those that are single-copy; for gene family copy number determination, easily
parsed output files contain absolute copy number of hits from the sequence similarity search.
