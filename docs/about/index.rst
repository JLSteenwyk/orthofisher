About
=====

**orthofisher** extracts and determines the copy number of a predetermined set of orthologs, which
can be used for the identification of single copy orthologous genes or estimation of gene family copy number.

Performance Assessment
----------------------
Using 291,604 sequence similarity searches across 1,294 eukaryotic proteomes, the performance of orthofisher
was compared to results obtained from BUSCO. Examination of precision, recall, and F-measure revealed the efficacy
of orthofisher's approach. More specifically, orthofisher had a **recall of 1.0, precision of 0.978195, and
an F-measure of 0.988977**. Precision is less than 1.0 because priors of expected sequence length and 
sequence similarity scores--which are not implemented in orthofisher--resulted in more missing genes in the BUSCO
pipeline than the orthofisher pipeline.
