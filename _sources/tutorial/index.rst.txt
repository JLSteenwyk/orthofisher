Tutorial
========

^^^^^

**orthofisher** enables researchers to conduct high-throughput identification
of orthologous genes using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). This tutorial covers the
easy-to-implement workflow needed for using orthofisher.

1. Download the test data
#########################

^^^^^

For ease of use, this tutorial will rely on a small dataset, which can be downloaded using
the following link:

.. centered::
   Download test data:
   :download:`tutorial dataset </data/orthofisher_tutorial.tar.gz>`

Next, unzip the downloaded directory and change directory to the newly downloaded directory.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ cd path_to_unzipped_directory/orthofisher_tutorial

|

2. Run orthofisher
##################

^^^^^

Two arguments are required when using orthofisher. 

The first arument, -f/--fasta, points to a two column file that points to the location 
of fasta files that will be searched using HMMs. Typically, these are protein fasta
files from the entire genome/transcriptome of an organism. Additionally, the second
column of the file specifies the identifier for the organism. This will be used when
representing sequences from a given proteome in a multi-fasta file. In this tutorial,
this is file **fasta_arg.txt**.

The second argument, -m is a file that points to the location of HMMs that you wish to 
identify or *fish out* of a given proteome. In this tutorial, this is file **hmms.txt**.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ orthofisher -m hmms.txt -f fasta_arg.txt

|

3. Examine output
#################

^^^^^

In the current working directory, a subdirectory will be made titled *orthofisher_output*.
Each subdirectory therein contains desirable output, which is briefly desired as:

1. all_sequences: multi-fasta file sequences of every hit identified during sequence similarity search.
2. hmmsearch_output: output files generated during hmmsearches
3. scog: a directory of single copy orthologous HMMs identified in the various fasta files

Also, two text files are made with helpful information that summarizes all the searches:

1. long_summary.txt: Hits identified during sequence similarity search per fasta file per HMM. 
HMMs are considered single-copy, multi-copy, or absent in a given fasta file.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ cat orthofisher_output/long_summary.txt
